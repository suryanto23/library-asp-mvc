## How To Run (For Visual Studio Community User)
I recommend for using [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) as the text editor.

Open appsettings.json file, change "ConnectionStrings" value to your corresponding database configuration:
- Data Source=YOUR_SERVER_NAME
- Initial Catalog=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
- User Id=YOUR_DBMS_USERNAME
- Pwd=YOUR_DBMS_PASSWORD

Afterward, run these commands in Package Manager Console (in case if you can't find the console, it located in Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console).

Adding migration to your DBMS (SQL):

```sh
 update-database
```

Finally, start running the project by clicking the run button on your text editor toolbar (or pressing Ctrl+F5).

## How To Run (For Visual Studio Code User) :

Open your CLI and go to the root directory. Afterward, run these commands below sequentially.

Install dotnet EF tools:
```sh
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

Adding migration :

```sh
dotnet ef database update --project id-card-simulator
```

Enter build command :

```sh
 dotnet run --project id-card-simulator
```

Finally, open your browser and go to the listening port (it written on your terminal).
